            <h1>New Illinois legislation seeks to standardize food inspection regulations</h1>
            <p>By William Tong, Sarah Kim and Mia Schmitt</p>

            <!-- <h2>title</h2> -->
            <p>Before Northwestern senior Ruby Chao and her boyfriend decided to try out The X POT, a Chinese and American fusion restaurant in Chicago that features Wagyu Beef, they dug into its previous health inspections. What they found put them off at first.</p>
            <p>“OBSERVED A BLACK SUBSTANCE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE ICE MACHINE LOCATED IN THE DISH WASHING AREA,” one Chicago Health Department inspection entry from April 2023 read. “INSTRUCTED TO CLEAN AND SANITIZE. PRIORITY VIOLATION. CITATION ISSUED.”</p>
            <p>Chao’s boyfriend cited those and other comments as a reason to not try out the spot. She ended up going anyway. </p>
            <p>“Because I was like, they failed their food inspection so long ago that surely they got it fixed by then,” Chao said. “Oh my gosh, and it was really good.” </p>
            <p>Across the board, Chicago has seen a recent rebound in restaurants and other food establishments passing city health inspections. That’s according to annual food inspection data dating back to 2010.  </p>
            <p>That trend is a little similar to New York City, which seems to have a different environment of food inspections. More than 90% of the city’s restaurants have ended up with some found violation during inspections between 2015 and 2025. </p>
            <p>For the city of Los Angeles, data is less available. Between 2016 and 2018, though, the number of “A” ratings the city’s inspectors assessed seemed to decrease — from more than 21,000 to 13,000. </p>
            <p>Most restaurants in the city received an “A” rating, which means that out of a scale of 100, a restaurant lost less than 10 points and had “generally superior in food handling practices and overall food facility maintenance,” according to the LA County website.</p>

            <p>One important change in Illinois’ food inspection regulations was the adoption of a revised FDA Food Code at the start of 2025. That guidance aims to standardize food safety requirements across states and locales, providing rules on what temperature to store meat and when to discuss proper handwashing techniques with food service employees. </p>
            <p>While Illinois’, Chicago’s and Cook County’s public health departments did not agree to interview requests about the new regulations, Evanston city spokesperson Cynthia Vargas said in an email that the suburb’s Health and Human Services Department has “not experienced any significant issues with any new food safety regulation.” </p>
            <p>In 2024, Evanston regulators conducted more than 1200 food safety inspections and responded to over 75 food related health incidents or complaints, she added. One restaurant was closed due to “critical” violations, Vargas said. </p>
            <p>The city has not completed a May 23 records request asking for its food establishment inspection data, which is not published online. </p>
            <p>For some foodies like Chao, however, it seems local governments are doing a fine job at keeping food safe. </p>
            <p>Though she uses Beli several times a week, Chao says she doesn’t recall having ever seen any posts about food safety on the popular restaurant commentary app. </p>
            <p>“Chicago restaurants have to disclose if they have any food safety issues though — it's public information,” Chao said. “So maybe that's why. Maybe other people are doing due diligence.”</p>
